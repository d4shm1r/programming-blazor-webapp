## Create New Project

Open *terminal* and create new project using:

```bash
dotnet new blazor -o Minecraft
```
Note you have to replace **Minecraft** with your desired name

## Open Project

From here you can continue in same terminal by adding two more commands. First change the directory then open it in **VS Code**:

```bash
cd Minecraft
code .
```
By running these commands you should verify that you see the project structure. Don't worry if you don't understand it.

## Run Project

In *terminal* to test and run the project run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```
This will build and give you the *localhost* link like this:

Open the link in browser and verify you have a working web application project like this:
